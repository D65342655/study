# MyProfile
seeking opportunities with professional organizations in finance-related fields to gain experience and fulfill my curious mind about financial work. While I am currently studying CFA preparation materials, making me need a clearer understanding of the professional environment and find the theoretical aspects to be somewhat limiting.
Hence, I aim to put what I have learned into practice and learn new skills that are not covered in my school faster through internship this time. I look forward to contributing and working with professionals in your organization.
